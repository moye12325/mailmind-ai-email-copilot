# Review Checklist

Use this checklist to review Codex-generated changes and human PRs. Findings should reference the relevant files and the source document that defines the expected behavior.

## Architecture Review

- Daily Digest remains the homepage and primary product entry point.
- System login remains separate from Gmail mailbox authorization.
- Provider Adapter boundaries are preserved.
- Gmail is the only runtime MVP email provider.
- Outlook and IMAP are not implemented in MVP code paths.
- Daily Digest versioning is preserved.
- Old successful Digest versions are not overwritten by refresh attempts.
- AI suggestions, provider state, and user behavior remain separate.
- No undocumented architecture change is introduced.

## Database Review

- Tables match `docs/database/DATABASE_DESIGN.md`.
- No `ai_actions` table is added.
- No independent `todos` or `risks` fact tables are added.
- `digest_items` remains the single source for dashboard items.
- `emails` does not store AI priority, AI summary, or action state.
- `daily_digests` enforces one current version per mailbox/date.
- `ai_runs` records AI call metadata and raw structured output.
- `user_actions` records user behavior and provider sync outcomes.
- `mailbox_credentials` stores encrypted credentials separately from `mailboxes`.
- Migrations do not silently change documented enums or constraints.

## API Review

- Routes match `docs/api/API_DESIGN.md`.
- All user-owned resources are filtered by authenticated user.
- Missing or unauthorized resources do not leak cross-user existence.
- `GET /api/digest/today` returns only the current digest.
- Digest generate and refresh endpoints return job status handles rather than blocking on long work.
- Email priority filtering uses current digest join, not `emails` AI fields.
- Mark-read and mark-unread validate ownership, permission mode, and `gmail.modify`.
- New API routes are not added without design review.

## Security Review

- No token in logs.
- No API key in logs.
- No email body text in logs.
- No full AI prompt in logs.
- Refresh token encrypted before storage.
- Access token is not stored long term in PostgreSQL.
- AI API key encrypted when stored in future V1 features.
- User ownership checked before every mailbox, email, digest, job, and action operation.
- No `gmail.send` scope.
- Gmail write operations require `write_enabled`.
- Provider success happens before local Gmail read/unread state update.
- SSRF handled for future custom AI provider endpoint.
- `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is never committed or logged.

## AI Pipeline Review

- LLM calls go through the AI pipeline, not scattered business code.
- AI output is validated against the documented JSON Schema.
- `suggested_action` enum matches PRD, AI Pipeline, and Database docs.
- Low-confidence handling follows documented downgrade behavior.
- `ai_runs` is created for AI calls.
- Full prompts and full email bodies are not logged.
- MVP uses `.env` AI provider configuration only.
- AI Provider UI and database-backed provider config are not added to MVP.
- Codex and Claude Code are not treated as LLM providers.

## Frontend Review

- Dashboard uses `GET /api/digest/today` as the main data source.
- The UI does not make the inbox the homepage.
- Gmail sync failures are visible and not faked as success.
- `/emails/new` is used for new-mail views.
- AI failure shows raw email fallback or previous digest, not a blank page.
- No email sending or auto-reply UI is added in MVP.
- No Outlook, IMAP, or AI Provider settings UI is added in MVP.

## Async Task Review

- Celery tasks update `sync_jobs`.
- Active job de-duplication uses `job_key`.
- Same mailbox/date does not run duplicate digest generation.
- Manual refresh priority does not bypass concurrency rules.
- Failed Digest generation preserves the previous current version.
- Redis new-mail cache does not store email bodies or secrets.
- Token refresh uses locking rules before refreshing shared credentials.
- Scheduled tasks do not compensate missed runs in MVP unless design changes.

## Testing Review

- Tests cover ownership checks.
- Tests cover Digest version switching and rollback behavior.
- Tests cover AI JSON parsing success and failure.
- Tests cover Gmail provider failure without local read-state mutation.
- Tests cover encrypted credential round-trip and no plaintext logging.
- Tests cover timezone window calculation.
- Tests cover frontend fallback states.
- Test failures are not hidden or weakened by changing product behavior.

## Automated Validation Gates

Future CI should include at least these gates:

- Backend tests.
- Backend lint.
- Frontend typecheck.
- Frontend lint.
- Database migration validation.
- Secret scanning.
- Documentation consistency checks.

Before CI exists, Codex must report which checks could not be run and why. After CI exists, PRs should not be considered complete until required checks pass or failures are explicitly explained.

## Harness Compliance Review

- Task ID exists.
- Task appears in `docs/engineering/TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`.
- Required input documents were consulted.
- Allowed files respected.
- Forbidden changes respected.
- Completion report provided.
- Tests or explanation included.
- No undocumented architecture change.
- New design questions are captured as design-review issues or unresolved questions.
